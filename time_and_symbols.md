# 'Time' and 'Symbols' meet 'Eigenwheels' :


This is the story of 'Time' and 'Symbols', they loved each other but didn't know how to sync between them, how to get along. 

'Reality' was becoming more complicated what resulted in their **quartz** ticking faster, their **maps** getting fuzzier and their **compass** twirling. 

All this made their life together much harder, 'Reality' and 'Ignorance' affected both in different ways, but also affected the quality of the 'Labels' they where able to design while creating 'sets'.

'Symbols' was too unpredictable in some situations and 'Time' was all about indexing events and in certain moments couldn't follow 'Symbols' **train-of-thoughts** . 

Some sequences made sense for both, but sometimes they found other sequences that gave the impression of being 'manipulated' by 'Ignorance' to feel wrong for both, to make them feel confused.  

They felt they needed to evolve and were ready to work on it. They realized they were under many levels of 'Ignorance'. 

So they decided to ask for help from their friends from the numbers world, $\pi$ , $e$, and $i$ (who was born an orphan), after a while more friends joined the team. 

They started working together, playing and brainstorming on how to help 'Time' and 'Symbols'  improve their relationship. 

They realized that special beings from another dimension they observed amazed sometimes while playing, called 'Eigenwheels', were $i$'s parents and that they were expecting to be seen.  

They had answers to give and wanted $i$ to meet new relatives called $1j$ 

They also wanted to help $i$ friends and show them the path of 'sound' , 'light' and 'color'

So, these 'complex beings' were able to guide 'Time' and 'Symbols' through fractals, waves of information, linearity, closed loops, and beautiful representations of reality, this insightful experience made them love each other much more, and made them stronger. 

They chose a spiral together and some lucky numbers and started dancing life together as one. 

$e$ met many infinite series and saw $exp()$ true potential in the mirror, and corssed to the other side to work. 

$\pi$ realized about own troubles with closing loops, and started a really beautiful friendship with $2$

$i$ thinks we go with the formulas...

They just had a possible **map**, **quartz**, and a **compass**, so:

'They' decide to define $M$ initial guess as: 

$$M=max(S)+1$$

So as a first attempt they  define a root of unity for representing all possible values of a curated representation of 'Reality' (encoded in $S_n$) as:

$$\zeta = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{M}}$$

'They' define a base period for this time just for luck to be:

$$ T_o  = 13 $$


We need a reduction factor to bound the size of the plot at the center of the complex plane, for this $T_o$ maybe:
$$F_f=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{T_o^2}$$


In the center of the plot we represent the values over time as: 

$$Z[n]=F_f·log_2(n+2)·\zeta^{S[n]}$$


And we have as root of unity for the discrete time index for the selected $T_o$:

$$ \tau = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{T_o}}$$



$$\delta[0]=\delta_0 =\frac{1}{T_o}$$

$$\delta[n] =\begin{cases} \delta_0\space for \space n=0\space mod\space T_{mod} \\
                     0\space for \space n > 0 \space mod\space T_{mod} \\
       \end{cases}$$

$$r[-1]=0$$


$$r[n] = r[n-1] + \delta[n] $$


Time evolves, and becomes interested in modularity:

$$\hat n[n] =r[n]·\tau^{n}$$


And finally this is how 'Time' and 'Symbols' get married:


$$\psi[n] = \hat n[n]+F_f·\zeta^{S[n]}$$

And with the help of their friends from the numbers world and new groups of friends called $T_o$ and $k·M$ they were able to live happily ever after 

After a divorce they realized they needed to learn more, much more...

Basic introduction  :


Consider the following sequences as closed loops:

 0,8,3,11,6,1,9,4,12,7,2,10,5 

and/or

0,5,10,2,7,12,4,9,1,6,11,3,8


Make the first,second and third difference for the sequence. Notice how the 'discrete-jerk' gives the key for $T_{color}$

'Pause-and-ponder' looking for the best $T_o$ , $T_{mod}$ and $T_{color}$




Does this sequence appear 'naturaly' in math?

Yes, and it is related to $\phi$
